# Where is everyone

A simple web app to keep track of your buddies at the ski resort, theme park, conference, or the like.

It's deployed at [where.meteor.com](http://where.meteor.com).

We used this when skiing together 5 families.
We kept dividing into small groups and wanted to know who was where in the ski system.

All you do is click once to tell people who you are with and where you are headed
(I usually do it while in the lift queue). Should be useful for other similar situations
where a bunch of people are in the same general area and want to keep track of
each other - like a bunch of friends at Disneyland or a conference resort.
